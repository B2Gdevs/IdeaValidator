![attention_grabber](https://github.com/B2Gdevs/IdeaValidator/blob/master/Idea_Validator.png)

This app is designed to allow entrepenuers get in touch with their potential customers and help generate an idea or feature that will
help users.  The app that was built based on a silicon valley episode.  I thought "what if there was an app for that?".

## Installation
You can find binaries of this app at http://portfolio5279.herokuapp.com/phone_apps, android(APK) and iphone(IPA) are available, however the iphone version is unsigned.  You will need to have a jailbroken iphone to install it.  But feel free to clone the repo, compile, and sign the app yourself if you want to.

## How to use
<hr/>
Ok so you have an idea you want to bring to life. You don't know if your app will make it or you need some kind of clarity so investors will fund the idea.  Well who are your customers going to be?  You can get feedback on the idea and use that to help with this situation.  This app was made with the idea that a founder needs to physically meet people so you take the app and talk to people about the idea.  You put in an idea, talk to someone and log their response in the app.  You can also generate a waitlist of emails using the app so you can have a customer base ready when you launch.

From the data portion of the app you can get the counts of the feedback and even export the data you've collected.  The app exports the data in to an email body and it can be sent to whomever needs it.
